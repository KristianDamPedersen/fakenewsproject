## Notes
#### Previous experience and qualifications

Jakup - Experience with Python. Not specifically data science. Hobby experience with Data Science.
Kristian - Experienced in Python, experienced in data cleaning and treatment. Hobby experience with remaining parts of data science.

#### How do we work best?
Josh - Consistent work, preferably without crunch weeks. Okay with sidetracks as long as it makes sense.
Jakup - Prefers following the course structure. Exercises closely aligned.
Krisitan - Strongly prefers pair programming & in-person working.

##### Ground rules
- Place: HCØ / DIKU (Not in the canteen, sitting by ourselves, no inclusion of people outside the group whilst working).
- Modality: Quick check-ins. No work unless 2 are present (unless otherwise decided).

##### Code standards
All code should be documented, tested and reviewed. LaTeX document should, as applicable, also be updated before turning in code. We aim towards
continous integration / delivery, so enforce frequent commits and merges to master. Prefer functional programming.

#### How do we deal with disagreements?
Demokratisk afstemning. Mulighed for at blive sat specifikt på dagsordenen næste gang vi mødes. Tredjepart afgører.

#### Working schedule and time commitment
- Ad hoc planning (updated each time we meet).
- 6t weekly commitment.


#### Setup and infrastructure (Version control etc.)
OBS. On the agenda next time.
