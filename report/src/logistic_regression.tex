\section{Simple model: Logistic Regression (1/2 page)} 
\todo{REWRITE!}
In this section we go the logistic regression model we created, to serve as a baseline for comparison for the more
complex model we discuss in section \ref{sec:complex_model}. We will go over how we prepared the data for the model,
including grouping of article types, TFIDF feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. We will then go over the
performance metrics we've chosen, as well as the specific hyper-parameters used in the model. Finally we will analyze
the result and comment on potential shortcomings of the model. 

\subsection{Model}
After preparing the data for training, we created our logistic regression model. When creating a logistic regression
model, there are a few important hyper-parameters to consider. First we have the choice of solver.
