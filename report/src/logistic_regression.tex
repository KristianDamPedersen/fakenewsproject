\section{Simple model: Logistic Regression} 
For our baseline, we chose to use a logistic regression model. Much of the heavy lifting in developing this model took place in the previous sections,
so once we reached this step we chose to just use a relatively naive implementation, using the default arguments provided
by \textit{scikit-learn}. This resulted in the following hyperparameters for our model. \textbf{Penalty}: l2. This form of penalty adds a penalty that is equal to the square of the magnitude of the
    coefficients of the model. In other words, it tries to limit the influence that any single coefficient has on the
    model. \textbf{Solver}: lbfgs (limited memory BFGS). This solver is one of the most general logistic regression
    solvers, and is therefore a natural fit when we don't wish to direct it further.
